libgmail - a C interface library for GMail
==========================================
Released under GPLv3
by David Kaplan, 2010 <david@2of1.org>

Once upon a time someone (Waseem Daher?) wrote a Python library by the same
name that provided an interface for gmail interaction.
That library unfortunately no longer works.
More unfortunately it was written in Python. 

This project provides a (hopefully) easy to use interface for gmail access and it's all in C and works through the Gmail imap interface.
